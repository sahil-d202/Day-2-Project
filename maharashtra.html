    <h2>About Maharashtra</h2>
    <p>
      Maharashtra, state of India, occupying a substantial portion of the Deccan
      plateau in the western peninsular part of the subcontinent. Its shape
      roughly resembles a triangle, with the 450-mile (725-km) western coastline
      forming the base and its interior narrowing to a blunt apex some 500 miles
      (800 km) to the east. Maharashtra is bounded by the Indian states of
      Gujarat to the northwest, Madhya Pradesh to the north, Chhattisgarh to the
      east, Telangana to the southeast, Karnataka to the south, and Goa to the
      southwest and by the union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and the
