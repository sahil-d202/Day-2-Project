    <h2>About India</h2>
    <p>
      India has a unique culture and is one of the oldest and greatest
      civilizations of the world. India has achieved all-round socio-economic
      progress since its Independence. India covers an area of 32,87,263 sq. km,
      extending from the snow-covered Himalayan heights to the tropical rain
      forests of the south. As the 7th largest country in the world, India
      stands apart from the rest of Asia, marked off as it is by mountains and
      the sea, which give the country a distinct geographical entity.
      <br />
      Bounded by the Great Himalayas in the north, it stretches southwards and
      at the Tropic of Cancer, tapers off into the Indian Ocean between the Bay
      of Bengal on the east and the Arabian Sea on the west. Lying entirely in
      the northern hemisphere, the mainland extends between latitudes 8째 4' and
      37째 6' north, longitudes 68째 7' and 97째 25' east and measures about 3,214
      km from north to south between the extreme latitudes and about 2,933 km
      from east to west between the extreme longitudes. It has a land frontier
      of about 15,200 km. The total length of the coastline of the mainland,
      Lakshadweep Islands and Andaman & Nicobar Islands is 7,516.6 km.
